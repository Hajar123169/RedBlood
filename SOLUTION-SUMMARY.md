# RedBlood App - Dependency Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue Addressed

The project was experiencing a dependency conflict during installation:

```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: redblood@1.0.0
npm error Found: react-native@0.79.2
npm error node_modules/react-native
npm error   react-native@"0.79.2" from the root project
npm error
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react-native@"^0.0.0-0 || 0.60 - 0.72 || 1000.0.0" from @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.18.2
```

This error occurred because the project was using react-native version 0.79.2, but @react-native-async-storage/async-storage version 1.18.2 is only compatible with react-native versions between 0.60-0.72 or 1000.0.0.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed @react-native-async-storage/async-storage from version ~1.18.2 to ^1.19.3
   ```diff
   - "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "~1.18.2",
   + "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.3",
   ```

2. **Created Documentation**:
   - Created DEPENDENCY-FIX.md with detailed explanation of the issue and solution
   - Updated SETUP-SUMMARY.md to mention the dependency fix
   - Updated README-SETUP.md to include information about the dependency fix in the troubleshooting section

## Why This Solution Works

The newer version of @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (1.19.3) likely has updated peer dependency requirements that include support for react-native 0.79.x. By updating to this version, we're using a package that's designed to work with the newer react-native version.

## How to Verify the Fix

To verify that the fix works:

1. Run `npm install` in the project directory
2. If the installation completes without errors, the fix was successful

If you still encounter issues, alternative approaches are documented in DEPENDENCY-FIX.md, including:
- Using `npm install --force`
- Using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Downgrading react-native to version 0.72.x

## Impact on the Project

This change should not affect the functionality of the app, as we're only updating the version of a dependency to maintain compatibility. The AsyncStorage API should remain the same across these versions.

All files that import AsyncStorage (AuthContext.js, ThemeContext.js, authService.js, and storageService.js) should continue to work as before with the updated version.
