# Where to Run `npx expo start`

## Answer

You should run the `npx expo start` command in the **root directory** of your project:

```
C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Desktop\RedBlood
```

**NOT** in the src directory:

```
C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Desktop\RedBlood\src
```

## Explanation

This is because:

1. The `package.json` file with the Expo scripts is located in the root directory
2. The `app.json` file containing Expo configuration is in the root directory
3. The main entry point `index.js` is in the root directory
4. The App.js component that gets rendered is in the root directory

When you run `npx expo start` from the root directory, Expo will correctly find all these configuration files and start your application properly.

## How to Run

1. Open your command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to the root directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Desktop\RedBlood
   ```
3. Run the Expo start command:
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```

This will start the Expo development server and provide you with options to run the app on different platforms (iOS, Android, web).
