# RedBlood App - Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue Description

When trying to install dependencies with `npm install`, the following error occurred:

```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: redblood@1.0.0
npm error Found: react-native@0.79.2
npm error node_modules/react-native
npm error   react-native@"0.79.2" from the root project
npm error
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react-native@"^0.0.0-0 || 0.60 - 0.72 || 1000.0.0" from @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.18.2
```

## Problem Analysis

The error indicates a version compatibility issue between:
- `react-native` version 0.79.2 (installed in the project)
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` version 1.18.2 (which requires react-native versions between 0.60-0.72 or 1000.0.0)

## Solution Applied

I've updated the package.json file to use a newer version of `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (version 1.19.3) which should be compatible with react-native 0.79.2.

```diff
- "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "~1.18.2",
+ "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.3",
```

## How to Test the Fix

1. Try installing dependencies again:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. If the installation completes without errors, the fix was successful.

## Alternative Solutions

If the updated version still causes conflicts, you can try one of these approaches:

1. **Use the `--force` flag**:
   ```
   npm install --force
   ```
   This will force npm to resolve dependencies and may ignore peer dependency requirements.

2. **Use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag**:
   ```
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   This tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts and use a legacy algorithm for dependency resolution.

3. **Downgrade react-native**:
   If you need to use the specific version of async-storage, you could downgrade react-native to version 0.72.x, which is within the compatible range.

## Why This Works

The newer version of `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` likely has updated peer dependency requirements that include support for react-native 0.79.x. By updating to this version, we're using a package that's designed to work with the newer react-native version.

## Impact on the Project

This change should not affect the functionality of the app, as we're only updating the version of a dependency to maintain compatibility. The AsyncStorage API should remain the same across these versions.
